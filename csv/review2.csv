This house is beautiful and was renovated with very modern and high end finishes. It is a perfect place for multi families as the downstairs area is essentially a second and separate living space. My brother's family of four loved having their own space to spread out. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the house met all our needs. We had one very minor issue with a door handle sticking and it was handled the same day. We would definitely come back if we visit Kauai in the future. Thanks Wendy
